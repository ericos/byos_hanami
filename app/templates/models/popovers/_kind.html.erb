<%= scope(:popover_content, name: :kind, label: "Kind").render do %>
  <p>The kind of model which can be one of two values:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Core</strong>: Means the model originates from the <a href="https://usetrmnl.com">Core</a> server and isn't meant to be updated or deleted because, upon the next models sync (i.e. Models Poller), the record will be updated or restored automatically.</li>
    <li><strong>Terminus</strong>: Means the model was created for this server only and can be freely managed without being affected by changes from the <a href="https://usetrmnl.com">Core</a> server.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This value is not editable since this is used to differentiate records between both servers.</p>
